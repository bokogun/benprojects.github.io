This was also measured by age-range, marital status and whether employment method was internal or external. The insights generated were helpful in pointing to the most performing-employee recruitment sources and  most reliable recruitment pipelines. Employee performances by age-range and marital status were clear to see for informed decision-making

										Employee Skills Gap Analysis for a Pharmaceutical Company</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pharma.jfif" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In the face of growing challenges due to skills mismatches across critical roles, HealthyLife Pharmaceuticals embarked on an in-depth analysis to identify and bridge these gaps, aiming to enhance productivity, job satisfaction, and overall performance. The project examined data from 5,000 employees, revealing that 15.34% are either partially or fully misaligned with their role requirements. Key roles in R&D, Finance, and Manufacturing were identified as most affected, impacting critical business areas such as quality control, financial accuracy, and innovation.
										The analysis found a strong correlation between targeted training and improved productivity, particularly in R&D and Sales departments. However, it also highlighted that employees with skills gaps could still perform well due to other compensating factors such as motivation, teamwork, and leveraging technology. The findings suggest that while proper skills alignment is crucial, other performance drivers should not be overlooked.
										To address these gaps, the project recommended targeted training programs, strategic recruitment, and personalized upskilling plans. Continuous skills assessment and predictive analytics were also suggested to anticipate future gaps and ensure ongoing alignment with industry demands. 
										 This project underscores the importance of skills alignment in driving organizational success and provides a roadmap for sustainable talent management at HealthyLife Pharmaceuticals

										User Experience Analysis on an Online Trading App Using Excel</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/online trade app.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This analysis examined user experience data for the Flextrade Online Shopping App, focusing on key performance indicators such as bounce rate, session duration, cart behaviour, and conversion rates. The project aimed to identify critical issues affecting user engagement and transaction completion, particularly addressing the high bounce rate and instances of cart abandonment that Flextrade was experiencing.
										Key insights from the data indicated no strong correlation between shorter sessions and higher bounce rates, nor a significant relationship between bounce rate and conversion rate, although there were notable exceptions. Feedback analysis highlighted both positive aspects such as excellent customer service and user-friendly app design, as well as challenges like app crashes and issues with the checkout process.
										To address these findings, several recommendations were made, including simplifying the checkout process, implementing a cross-selling strategy, and leveraging machine learning to provide personalized product recommendations.
